<p><em>Restaurants, hospitals, grocery stores, school cafeterias, any place that stores food has refrigeration needs. Moreover, those refrigerators need to be monitored so that they meet state health codes and food doesnâ€™t spoil.</em><br />
<br />
Geographically, commercial refrigeration would be a much easier market for a new small business to access. Target customers exist in almost every town and city across the country.<br />
<br />
However, the multitude of target customers combined with the relative simplicity of temperature sensing hardware and low margins of food-serving establishments (mostly restaurants) means there is not a lot of room for a profitable product line. The customer acquisition cost alone for a hardware product like this would be untenable, not to mention the ongoing SaaS maintenance costs.  There would be little margin left for continued R&amp;D, which is a large part of my <a href="#modal3" data-toggle="modal">value proposition</a> in using a SaaS pricing model with hardware.</p>
