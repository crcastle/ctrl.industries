I wanted to quickly understand the feasibility of the product, the costs involved, and the knowledge I would need to build a prototype. This included extensive research in</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embedded Systems</li>
  <li>Microcontrollers</li>
  <li>Switched Mode Power Supply Design</li>
  <li>Cellular Communication Hardware</li>
  <li><abbr class="initialism" title="Machine to Machine">M2M</abbr> Cellular Service Technologies and Providers</li>
  <li>Embedded Camera Modules</li>
  <li>Power Consumption Optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this research, I sourced the minimally necessary components and built a prood-of-concept.</p>
