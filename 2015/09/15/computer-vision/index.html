<p><em>Computer Vision enabled a key component of Gauge Reader: the ability to flexibly translate an analog gauge reading to a digital value.</em><br />

Computer Vision allows a computer to understand information about the physical world â€“ or in my case, allows a computer to read <a href="#modal4" data-toggle="modal">various</a> <a href="#modal5" data-toggle="modal">types</a> <a href="#modal6" data-toggle="modal">of</a> <a href="#modal7" data-toggle="modal">analog</a> <a href="#modal8" data-toggle="modal">gauges</a>.<br />
<br />
Just like electronic hardware design and production, Computer Vision was an area about which I knew very little.  After reviewing multiple academic papers<sup><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2015/283629/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.imeko.org/publications/tc4-2008/IMEKO-TC4-2008-122.pdf">2</a>, <a href="http://www.asee.org/documents/zones/zone1/2014/Student/PDFs/116.pdf">3</a>, <a href="http://www.jcomputers.us/vol9/jcp0904-01.pdf">4</a></sup> on using Computer Vision with analog gauges, I began using Python and <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> to design an algorithm that could quickly and accurately read the image of an analog gauge.<br />
<br />
Within three weeks I had an algorithm that could read many analog gauges in addition to a web-based tuning <abbr class="initialism" title="User Interface">UI</abbr> so that the system could quickly be adapted to new gauge faces. Pretty awesome to see the messy physical world translated to the binary world.</p>
