<p><em>In one week, I taught myself Electronic Design Automation software and the Electrical Engineering concepts I needed to create a printed circuit board.</em><br />
<br />
This was very much a <i>just-in-time</i> learning process, and I quickly iterated between periods of research and production.<br />
<br />
Within two weeks, I had a circuit board design sent off to a <abbr class="initialism" title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr> fabricator.  During the two week turn-around time I had plenty of other work to keep me busy, including tooling setup, component sourcing, and the server-side software with which Gauge Reader would communicate.</p>
