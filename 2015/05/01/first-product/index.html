<p><em>Analog gauge reader for residential and commercial heating and hot water propane tanks. While products exist in this market, they are expensive, slow to setup, overly complex, and aren’t updated frequently in response to customer feedback – a perfect market conditions to disrupt!</em><br />
<br />
A friend’s family member asked “Why isn’t there a way for me to know the real-time level of my customers’ tanks? It seems like this should be easy to solve.” He runs a propane distribution company and has to put a driver in a delivery truck to check and, if low, fill-up customer tanks. And while he has software to estimate customer tank levels based on historical consumption and weather, the software requires accurate data-entry and cannot account for unexpected changes in consumption from visiting guests, vacations, kids going off to college, babies being born, interior renovations, etc.<br />

But I ran in to one big problem while doing market research. Propane is not used much in Washington state relative to other states. According to the <a href="http://www.eia.gov">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>, Washington state is ranked 34th in its use of propane as a percentage of all non-vehicle fuels used. Additionally, of the 3.2 billion BTUs of propane consumed in the United States in 2013, <a href="#modal1" data-toggle="modal">just six states consume 74% of it</a>, and I don’t live anywhere near those six states: Texas, Kansas, Lousiana, Iowa, Vermont, and New Hampshire. It doesn’t make much sense to start a business to serve a market that’s hard for me to access.</p>
