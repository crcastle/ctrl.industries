I wanted to quickly understand the feasibility of the product, the costs involved, and the knowledge I would need to build a prototype. This included extensive research in

* Embedded Systems
* Microcontrollers
* Switched Mode Power Supply Design
* Cellular Communication Hardware
* <abbr class="initialism" title="Machine to Machine">M2M</abbr> Cellular Service Technologies and Providers
* Embedded Camera Modules
* Power Consumption Optimization

Following this research, I sourced the minimally necessary components and built a prood-of-concept.
