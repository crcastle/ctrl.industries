During field testing I needed to verify all of my initial design requirements and stress test the hardware before testing it in a customer installation.\\

Beyond the basic functionality, I needed to ensure the hardware would stand up to the harsh conditions that are normal for industries it was designed to serve.  Oil and gas, construction, forestry all require functioning equipment regardless of the natural (and man made conditions) thrown at it.
