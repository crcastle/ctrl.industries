*Restaurants, hospitals, grocery stores, school cafeterias, any place that stores food has refrigeration needs. Moreover, those refrigerators need to be monitored so that they meet state health codes and food doesn't spoil.*\\

Geographically, commercial refrigeration would be a much easier market for a new small business to access. Target customers exist in almost every town and city across the country.\\

However, the multitude of target customers combined with the relative simplicity of temperature sensing hardware and low margins of food-serving establishments (mostly restaurants) means there is not a lot of room for a profitable product line. The customer acquisition cost alone for a hardware product like this would be untenable, not to mention the ongoing SaaS maintenance costs.  There would be little margin left for continued R&D, which is a large part of my [value proposition](#modal3){:data-toggle="modal"} in using a SaaS pricing model with hardware.
