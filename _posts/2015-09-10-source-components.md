*Sourcing electrical components can be a full time job by itself. Multiple variables need to be compared to find the components with the optimal balance of characteristics.*\\
\\
I compared hundreds and sometimes even thousands of surface mount passive components like resistors and capacitors, board-to-board connectors, battery holders, waterproof enclosures, and mounting hardware.\\
\\
For each of these components, variables such as price, physical size, voltage and current tolerance, operating temperature range, temperature coefficient, heat dissipation, equivalent series resistance, and quiescent current needed to be evaluated at the same time. Additionally there is an art to being able to quickly read and extract the necessary information from electrical component datasheets.
